# lacona-convert-currency

Lacona Addon to convert between various monetary currencies.

![Animation of the Addon in Action](img/graphic.gif)

Conversion rates are taken from fixer.io, which updates daily around 4pm CET. The available currencies are the ones provided by the European Central Bank, which is why there is a European focus.

Some included plural forms of currency names are not valid in the original languages, but may seem normal to English speakers.

If any names, symbols, or pluralizations are invalid, please submit a PR or an issue.

This addon comes with no warranty.
